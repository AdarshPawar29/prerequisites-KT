# 4. SCSS/SASS:

Sass stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet

Sass is an extension to CSS

Sass is a CSS pre-processor

Sass is completely compatible with all versions of CSS

Sass reduces repetition of CSS and therefore saves time

# 5. BEM SYNTAX:

BEM stands for BLOCK ELEMENT MODIFIER. When it comes to larger, more complex projects, how you organize your code is the key to efficiency in at least these three ways: it affects how long it takes you to write code, how much of that code you’ll have to write and how much loading your browser will have to do. This becomes especially important when you’re working with teams of themers, and when high performance is essential.
